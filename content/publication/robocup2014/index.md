abstract: The new RoboCup Logistics League sponsored by Festo offers a competition within a simulated industrial environment. In order to solve the logistical tasks, all three Robotinos not only have to operate autonomously in a flexible, effective and robust way on their own, they should also collaborate efficiently in order to maximize the overall outcome. In this paper, the first world champion of the Logistics League, TUMsBendingUnits from the Technical University of Munich (TUM), presents their logistical system with focus on approaches concerning robot hardware modifications, software architecture, task planning and execution, multi-robot collaboration, visual perception, motion planning and execution.
