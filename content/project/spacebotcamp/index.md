In the SpacebotCamp, a mobile system had to explore an unknwon area, find two objects and bring them to a third object for assembly. All tasks had to be done with a high level of autonomy since communication was delayed by 2 seconds and sending commands was limited to only a few occasions. The whole task had to be done in 60 minutes.

RMexplores! was the only team that fulfilled all tasks within the given specification. This was accomplished in halve of the time!


My responsibilities: Autonomous Task Control, System Architecture
